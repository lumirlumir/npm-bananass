## Hello, Bananass!

Welcome to the Bananass<sup>🍌🍌🍌🍌</sup> framework.🎉

The Bananass Framework is a **Baekjoon framework for JavaScript** created by [LuMir](https://github.com/lumirlumir), designed for more convenient problem-solving in the Baekjoon Node.js environment.

You no longer need to write template code using the `readline` or `fs` modules and copy-paste it every time! With the Bananass Framework, you can experience more convenient problem-solving, just like writing a single solution function<sup>`function solution() {}`</sup> on [**Programmers**](https://programmers.co.kr/).

But do we really need to learn a framework just to solve Baekjoon problems? Let's find out why below!

## Why Bananass?

Why hasn't there been a framework specialized for problem-solving among the numerous frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem? Shall we take a look at an example of solving the [Baekjoon Problem 1000: A+B](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1000) using JavaScript together?

- Before: Solving the problem using the traditional method.

    ```js
    const readline = require('node:readline');
    const { EOL } = require('node:os');

    let inputStr = '';

    const rl = readline.createInterface({
      input: process.stdin,
      output: process.stdout,
    });

    rl.on('line', line => {
      inputStr = `${inputStr}${line}${EOL}`;

    }).on('close', () => {
      console.log(solution(inputStr));

      process.exit(0);
    });

    function solution(inputStr) {
      const input = inputStr
        .trim()
        .split(' ')
        .map(val => Number(val));

      const [a, b] = input;

      return a + b;
    }
    ```

- After: Solving the problem using the Bananass Framework.

    ```js
    function solution(input) {
      const [a, b] = input
        .trim()
        .split(' ')
        .map(Number);

      console.log(a + b);
    }

    module.exports = solution;
    ```

Wow!😲 Isn't it amazing? Now you can focus solely on the algorithm logic with simplified code.

But is that all? Of course not!

- Use of the latest syntax like ES2025, not limited to the Baekjoon Node.js environment
- Use of custom modules and external libraries like `lodash`
- Built-in support for ESLint and Prettier
- Extensive documentation and community support
- ...

How about it? Wouldn't you like to experience more convenient problem-solving with the Bananass Framework?🤔

## Getting Started with Bananass

Like `create-react-app` for React and `create-next-app` for Next.js,

**Experience a new paradigm in problem-solving right now with `create-bananass-app` provided by the Bananass Framework!**

You can instantly install and use the Bananass Framework with `create-bananass-app`! (Although it's not really an app<sup>App</sup>, but that's not important...🤔)

```sh
npx create-bananass-app my-bananass-app --no-install
```
