## Explanation {#explanation}

It can be mathematically proven that among three consecutive strings, at least one of them corresponds to a number that is not 'Fizz', 'Buzz', or 'FizzBuzz'.

Therefore, we determine the next number based on that number, transform it according to the conditions, and output it.
